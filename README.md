Please see notebooks dir to access the code. 


## Data Cleaning
Cleaning Pipeline logic is in data_preprocessing directory. 

Run data_extraction.py to get the data, then run y_declaration to derive target var. I plan on making this more modular in the future



## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
EDA is contained in the EDA directory. 

Currently exploring the target variable and deciding on further cleaning logic before adding features for the model
